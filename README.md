# Tic-Tac-Toe Client !

## About this project

- This is a tic-tac-toe project featuring local / web multiplayer. The front-end of this project is connected to an API deployed on heroku. That server is responsible for creating / storing users, and also changing game state.

- This project also features some bots to play against. There are three modes : Easy, Medium, and Hard. Easy is a bot that randomly chooses a spot on the board. And Hard is the bot that utilizes the minimax algorithm to find the most beneficial move, I challenge you to try and beat it. Lastly, Medium is a bot that switches from Easy to Hard mode depending on how many spots there are on the board. If there is an even amount of moves on the board then the bot will use the minimax function, and if there isn't then it'll alternate to the random move function.
